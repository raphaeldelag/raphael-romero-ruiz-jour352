During my time on this beat, I wrote about the increasing American military build-up at the southern border and the evolving authorities given to military personnel for immigration law enforcement. I analyzed monthly migrant apprehension and drug seizure data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and maintained a list of government official sources. I frequently traveled across the Arizona borderlands for stories on topics like tribal land sovereignty and local law enforcement. I aided in developing strategy with reporters across the newsroom to identify coverage needs during the first 100 days of the second Trump administration. I also authored a weekly newsletter highlighting key immigration and border related developments and covered the 2024 presidential campaign trail.</p>
