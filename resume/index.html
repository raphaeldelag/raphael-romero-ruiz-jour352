    <h2>Experience:</h2>
         <h3>Border Reporter</h3>
  <h4>The Arizona Republic/La Voz Arizona</h4>
  <h5>April 2024- July 2025</h5>
  <p>As a border reporter, I wrote about the dynamic environment that is the U.S. southern border providing readers an update on federal policy changes, news on multiple agencies from the Department of Homeland Security and documented how everyday peopleï¿½s lives were being affected by our decisionmakers in Washington D.C. During my time on this beat, I wrote about the increasing American military build-up at the southern border and the evolving authorities given to military personnel for immigration law enforcement. I analyzed monthly migrant apprehension and drug seizure data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and maintained a list of government official sources. I frequently traveled across the Arizona borderlands for stories on topics like tribal land sovereignty and local law enforcement.I aided in in developing strategy with reporters across the newsroom to identify coverage needs during the first 100 days of the second Trump administration. I also author a weekly newsletter highlighting key immigration and border related developments and cover the 2024 presidential campaign trail for both Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump.
