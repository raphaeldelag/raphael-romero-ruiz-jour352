          <div class="job-title">Border Reporter</div>
          <div class="organization">The Arizona Republic/La Voz Arizona</div>
          <div class="date">April 2024 - July 2025</div>
          <p class="description">As a border reporter, I wrote about the dynamic environment that is the U.S. southern border providing readers an update on federal policy changes, news on multiple agencies from the Department of Homeland Security and documented how everyday people's lives were being affected by our decisionmakers in Washington D.C. During my time on this beat, I wrote about the increasing American military build-up at the southern border and the evolving authorities given to military personnel for immigration law enforcement. I analyzed monthly migrant apprehension and drug seizure data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and maintained a list of government official sources. I frequently traveled across the Arizona borderlands for stories on topics like tribal land sovereignty and local law enforcement. I aided in developing strategy with reporters across the newsroom to identify coverage needs during the first 100 days of the second Trump administration. I also authored a weekly newsletter highlighting key immigration and border related developments and covered the 2024 presidential campaign trail.</p>

          <div class="date">April 2022 - April 2024</div>
          <p class="description">In this role, I conducted research and gathered data through search analytics, social media, and community outreach to inform my reporting and identify trends of interest to my target audience. I wrote articles appealing to top-of-funnel audiences and created engaging content. I also planned and executed social media strategies for The Arizona Republic and La Voz Arizona, focusing on reaching a younger, Latine audience. I designed visual products to accompany social media content and articles and collaborated with other teams, such as the photography and video teams, to create quality visual content that enhanced storytelling.</p>

          <p class="description">As a bilingual reporter intern, I developed and executed a comprehensive social media strategy to attract a younger audience to La Voz Arizona's brand via Instagram, which significantly increased followers and engagement. I conducted extensive research and pitched compelling stories that added depth to the coverage of the Latine/x communities in the Phoenix Metro area, resulting in several published articles. I also contributed to the "Faces of Arizona" project and translated stories of interest for Spanish-speaking readers.</p>
